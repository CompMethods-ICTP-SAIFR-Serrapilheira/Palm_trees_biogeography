abstract = {The vast extent of the Amazon Basin has historically restricted the study of its tree communities to the local and regional scales. Here, we provide empirical data on the commonness, rarity, and richness of lowland tree species across the entire Amazon Basin and Guiana Shield (Amazonia), collected in 1170 tree plots in all major forest types. Extrapolations suggest that Amazonia harbors roughly 16,000 tree species, of which just 227 (1.4%) account for half of all trees. Most of these are habitat specialists and only dominant in one or two regions of the basin. We discuss some implications of the finding that a small group of species - less diverse than the North American tree flora - accounts for half of the world's most diverse tree community.},

abstract = {Published phylogeny reconstructions of the palm family (Arecaceae) are based on plastid DNA sequences or restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), nuclear DNA sequences, morphological characters or a combination thereof, and include between 33 and 90 palm species. The present study represents all previously recognized subfamilies, tribes and subtribes of palms and 161 of the 189 genera. The plastid DNA region matK was sequenced for 178 palm species and ten commelinid monocot outgroup species, and was combined with new and previously published plastid DNA sequences of trnL-trnF, rps16 intron and rbcL. The addition of matK sequences and more taxa resulted in a highly resolved and largely well-supported phylogeny. Most importantly, critical basal nodes are now fully resolved and, in most cases, strongly supported. On the basis of this phylogeny, we have established a new subfamilial classification of the palms, in which five subfamilies are recognized, rather than the six that were included in the previous classification. The circumscriptions of the subfamilies Calamoideae and Nypoideae were corroborated. The phylogeny supported a new circumscription for the subfamily Coryphoideae, including all taxa previously recognized in Coryphoideae with the addition of the tribe Caryoteae, formerly of the subfamily Arecoideae. The phylogenetic analysis also supported a new delimitation for the subfamily Ceroxyloideae that contains the tribes Cyclospatheae and Ceroxyleae, and all genera formerly included in the subfamily Phytelephantoideae, but excludes the tribe Hyophorbeae. Finally, the subfamily Arecoideae was modified to exclude the tribe Caryoteae and to include the tribe Hyophorbeae. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Linnean Society of London.},

abstract = {The remarkable morphological diversity of the palm subfamily Calamoideae provides a par- adigm for evolutionary studies of palm structure and function. Phylogenetic relationships among the 22 calamoid genera are investigated here in simultaneous analyses of morphological data and DNA sequences from nuclear ITS regions and the chloroplast rpsl6 intron. The resultant hypotheses of relationship are used to explore morphological character evolution through an examination of character state optimisations. The evolution of habit and its associated characters is found to be highly homoplasious; for example, multiple origins of both the acaulescent and climbing growth forms have been identified. Similarly, life history and reproductive characters show complex patterns of evolution with few primary homology assessments proving to be effective judgements of synapomorphy. Many of these homoplasious characters were emphasized in the previous classification of the Calamoideae and consequently some non-monophyletic groups were rec- ognized formally. We present a new classification in which a number of unexpected, group-defining char- acters, such as the number of pollen apertures, have been identified. The classification comprises three tribes and nine subtribes, including one newly described tribe Eugeissoneae. However, the morphology of many well supported clades remains poorly understood, creating further challenges for future studies in calamoid phylogeny.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships among the 22 genera of the palm subfamily Calamoideae were investigated using DNA sequence data from the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and the chloroplast rps16 intron. The rps16 intron displayed low levels of variation, corroborating previous reports that the chloroplast genome of palms is highly conserved. High levels of within-individual polymorphism were identified in the ITS region, indicating that concerted evolution is not effectively homogenizing the ITS repeats. In the majority of cases, multiple clones from individuals resolved as monophyletic. However, the high levels of homoplasy in the ITS dataset, along with generally poor jackknife support for many clades, led to concerns that topologies obtained from these data might be unreliable. Nevertheless, congruence between trees based on ITS data alone and those based on rps16 intron data was high. Simultaneous analyses of both datasets yielded well-resolved topologies with high levels of jackknife support. A number of exciting groups emerged from the analyses: the African rattan clade comprising the endemic African rattan genera Laccosperma, Eremospatha, and Oncocalamus; the Lepidocaryeae-Raphia clade comprising the fan-leaved New World tribe Lepidocaryeae and the African genus Raphia; and the Asian clade comprising all Asian genera except Eugeissona. The position of Eugeissona was variable, although it did not resolve inside any of the three major clades mentioned above. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Species occurrence records from online databases are an indispensable resource in ecological, biogeographical and palaeontological research. However, issues with data quality, especially incorrect geo-referencing or dating, can diminish their usefulness. Manual cleaning is time-consuming, error prone, difficult to reproduce and limited to known geographical areas and taxonomic groups, making it impractical for datasets with thousands or millions of records. Here, we present CoordinateCleaner, an r-package to scan datasets of species occurrence records for geo-referencing and dating imprecisions and data entry errors in a standardized and reproducible way. CoordinateCleaner is tailored to problems common in biological and palaeontological databases and can handle datasets with millions of records. The software includes (a) functions to flag potentially problematic coordinate records based on geographical gazetteers, (b) a global database of 9,691 geo-referenced biodiversity institutions to identify records that are likely from horticulture or captivity, (c) novel algorithms to identify datasets with rasterized data, conversion errors and strong decimal rounding and (d) spatio-temporal tests for fossils. We describe the individual functions available in CoordinateCleaner and demonstrate them on more than 90 million occurrences of flowering plants from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and 19,000 fossil occurrences from the Palaeobiology Database (PBDB). We find that in GBIF more than 3.4 million records (3.7%) are potentially problematic and that 179 of the tested contributing datasets (18.5%) might be biased by rasterized coordinates. In PBDB, 1205 records (6.3%) are potentially problematic. All cleaning functions and the biodiversity institution database are open-source and available within the CoordinateCleaner r-package.},
